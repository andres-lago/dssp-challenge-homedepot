100130,"TERRO Outdoor Liquid Ant Bait Stakes attract and kill all common household ants, including Argentine ants, ghost ants, cornfield ants, pavement ants, acrobat ants, white footed ants, little black ants, odorous house ants and other sweet eating ants. To kill the ants you see and the ants you don't, simply place the pre-filled liquid bait stakes outdoors in areas where ants are observed.  Ants typically follow defined trails from the nest to food or water.  Placing the outdoor stakes close to these trails will improve control. While the active ingredient in TERRO Outdoor Liquid Ant Bait Stakes will ultimately kill the worker ant, it works slowly to allow worker ants to consume the product and survive long enough to carry the liquid back to the nest and deliver a dose to the rest of the colony. The key to obtaining effective control is to monitor the placements and ensure there is always a fresh supply of TERRO. Depending on the size of the infestation, complete control may take up to two weeks. The patented TERRO Outdoor Liquid Ant Bait Stakes feature reinforced stake ridges that provide increased strength when placed in the ground. A see-through window makes it easy to monitor the bait level so you know when it's time to replace the stake. The tiered bait pack increases bait consumption and reduces waste. Along with these features, the liquid ant bait inside the stake offers ants both a food and water source.Kills ants outside before they get insidePre-filled bait stations are ready-to-useContains boraxKills the ants you see and the ants you don'tWeatherproof station protects the bait from the elements, prevents it from drying out"

Plus get the air cleaning benefits of the ionic air purifier. The remote control allows you to easily change settings.

An air stream is then blown out the front of the unit and is considerably cooler than the current room temperature. This is not an air conditioner and therefore uses much less energy.

100570,"This Evaporative Air Cooler, Humidifier, and Fan is versatile, lightweight and economical. The Cooler easily rolls from room to room for use anywhere in your house or office. This Air Cooler shoots a stream of air with oscillating louvers, to evenly distribute refreshing cool air. Can also be used as a fan or humidifier if temperature is not an issue. The remote control allows you to easily change settings. The Air Cooler works by endothermic reaction (a reaction that consumes heat), so this evaporative Air Cooler sucks air through a wick saturated with water. As the air flows through the wick, some of the water evaporates into the air, consuming the heat that was in the air. An air stream is then blown out the front of the unit and is considerably cooler than the current room temperature. This is not an air conditioner and therefore uses much less energy. Note: This unit is NOT an air conditioner and does not have a compressor inside - air coolers will not lower a room's ambient temperature. Air coolers are designed for spot cooling. This unit is best used in dry climates or open spaces. Leave window/door open to limit the rise of humidity and for better air ventilation in the room.

They are far more efficient and substantially more economical compared to conventional central air conditioning systems. Ductless Mini Split systems are comprised of two main components: 1) The outdoor unit (Condensing Unit), and 2) The indoor unit (Evaporator Unit). The installation is simple. The indoor unit hangs on a metal bracket (supplied) that attaches to the interior wall, much like a picture frame. A 3 in. hole is then drilled through the wall. The Line set and communication wires are passed through this hole and connect the indoor and outdoor unit together. The Main power is supplied to the outdoor unit. The indoor unit draws its power from the outdoor unit. The system is operated by a wireless remote control (supplied). Simply set the remote control to the desired temperature and the system maintains the desired temperature.Capacity: 12,500 BTU (1 ton) cooling 12,000 BTU (1 ton) heating (heat pump)Power requirements: 120V/60 Hz, single phase powered from the outdoor unitArea coverage: Up to 540 sq. ft.Functions: cooling, independent dehumidification, and heating (heat pump)Efficiency rating: high efficiency (SEER  13.0)Refrigerant: pre-charged with environmentally-friendly dupont R410A refrigerantComplete system: includes indoor unit, outdoor unit, complete installation kit, 25 ft. of insulated copper line set, remote control includedQuiet operation: low noise, includes sleep functionEasy installation: includes installation kit; quick install system: pre-wired indoor unit (25 ft. cable) with quick connection; pre-flared and flanged insulated copper line set kit; quick install system cuts installation time in halfFeatures: indoor unit digital display of temperature (F), functions and error messages; 3 fan speeds; auto-restart: in case of power outage, the system restarts automatically to previous settings; self-diagnostic system: in case of malfunction, the indoor unit display shows error message codes; 24 hour start/stop timer; multi-directional oscillating indoor unit louver; automatic defrost function for heat pump; indoor unit dual washable filters and 3m particle filters; advanced microprocessor controlled system for smart operation and advanced temperature monitoringMulti-function digital wireless remote control with wall-mount cradle/holderCorrosion resistant outdoor unit paint can withstand direct sunlight, rain, snow and harsh environmentsEquipment should be sized, selected and installed by a qualified professional to ensure proper installation, function, safe operation, adherence to federal, state and local codes and for valid warranty; see installation guide and manufactures warranty statement for more detailsRecommended for professional purchase"

102160,"Utilizing Avallon's exclusive InvisiMist drain technology, the APAC140C liberates you from ever having to drain an internal reservoir again. As warm air and humidity are normally associated, we engineered this portable air conditioner (PAC) to remove up to 86 pints of moisture from your air per day. In many cases, the APAC140C's self-evaporative function will expel the majority of air moisture. However, in high humidity environments, self-evaporation is not enough. Excess water accumulates in the internal reservoir and, to prevent itself from overflowing onto your floor, a PAC will automatically turn off. This can happen at any time and will require you to manually drain the PAC. The InvisiMist system solves this problem. Consisting of an internal drain pump, a water line and our InvisiMist nozzle, the InvisiMist system automatically turns on when water accumulates and safely disposes of it through the easy-to-assemble window kit. This unit is more powerful than other 14,000 BTU PACs, cooling your space up to 40% more quickly because of its dual hose air system, which separates intake and exhaust, allowing for more air intake and cooling power. The three (3) adjustable fan speeds allow you to customize the unit's operations to suit your cooling preferences. Included casters allow you move this PAC to wherever you need it, and the included remote with LED display enables you to easily change operating settings.14,000 BTU Cooling power cools rooms up to 525 sq. ft.Includes three (3) piece window kit that will fit into windows ranging from 20 in. - 46 in.Exhaust hose measures 5 in.

102195,"The outside of a home is exposed to harsh outdoor elements throughout the year. Extreme heat, the sun's UV rays, and freezing temperatures can cause acrylic and siliconized acrylic caulks to lose flexibility and degrade. GE Silicone II Window and Door is permanently flexible and will not break down so it can protect a home as it settles or as the seasons change and joints expand and contract. This movement can cause degraded acrylic caulk to crack and crumble over time, leaving gaps for air and water to seep through. Those leaks can lead to water damage, mold growth, and higher energy bills. GE Silicone II Window and Door develops strength and adhesion quickly so it can be exposed to water in as little as 30 minutes. Some caulk requires up to 24 hours or longer before it can be exposed to water. For homeowners trying to squeeze home maintenance projects into the weekend or pros who are looking to move on to the next job, GE Silicone II can decrease the waiting time, helping increase convenience, speed, and efficiency. 100% Silicone sealant is widely considered to be the best caulk for sealing areas that will be exposed to water.TYPICAL SILICONE SEALANT USES INCLUDE CAULKING AROUND: windows, doors, siding, trim, moulding, baseboards, vents, around wires/pipes and other attic/ basement applicationsADHERES To: most wood, metal, vinyl siding, masonry, brick, concrete, drywall/ plaster, glass and plastic100% SiliconeLifetime Guarantee - will not shrink, crack, break down, wash away or yellowWeatherproof, sun-proof, freeze-proof, flexible30 minute rain-ready, caulk can be exposed to rain in as little as 30 minutes and the caulk won't wash away.Permanently waterproofFeatures mold-free product protectionCan be applied to wet or dry surfacesLow VOCRemains soft and flexibleMeets Fed spec TT-S-00230C; TT-S-001543A/ASTM C-920, Type-S, NS, Class 25 use NT, M, G, A & O test requirements.100% Silicone is 100% Waterproof.

102616,"Welcome to the best mirror slider doors money can buy. Our sliding mirror closet doors are  solid MDF (Medium Density Fiberboard). Laminating the mirror directly to the surface creates a much safer pierce resistant mirror door. Most mirror doors are simply mesh backed mirror in a lightweight frame.

103559,"AM07 Dyson Cool Tower fan Instead of using blades, Dyson fans use patented Air Multiplier technology for powerful air projection. Air is accelerated through an annular aperture, drawing in surrounding air to project a high-velocity cooling airflow. And with no blades, the airflow is smooth - not choppy. Dyson engineers developed AM07 to be 60% quieter and more energy efficient than its predecessor AM02. Streamlined air channels reduce airflow turbulence so that air passes through the machine more quietly and with greater efficiency. It also has an acoustically engineered motor bucket to reduce vibration and therefore noise.  Energy efficiency has also been improved. With smoother airflow through the machine, the DC motor doesn't need to work so hard so less energy is required to channel the air.  The addition of a sleep timer enables you to program the fan to turn off after preset time periods ranging from 15 minutes to 9 hours. AM07 comes with a remote control providing 10 precise airflow settings - as well as one touch oscillation control for smoother oscillation. For extra convenience, the remote is curved and magnetized to store neatly on the machine.  AM07 Tower fan has a projection range of six meters. It's designed to fit neatly into tight spaces, or on top of counters.  With no fast-spinning blades or awkward safety grilles, AM07 is safe and easy to clean.

103695,"For a quick, hassle free installation, use EXTREME Ipe Clip hidden deck fasteners with a 3/32 in. gap. These offer installers an immaculately smooth, fastener-free deck. EXTREME fasteners are fashioned to use an edge-mount system for hardwood decks. Accordingly, this allows EXTREME fasteners to be virtually invisible after installation. This patented design behaves as a camouflaging agent between deck board gaps, keeping the fastener hidden. The EXTREME fastener is formed from a molded polyethylene improving its UV and chemical resistant attributes. EXTREME fasteners are produced with a stainless steel insert which is coated with a black oxide finish. This hardened insert aids with attaching decking to joists. When compared to other trusted hidden fastening systems, EXTREME is up to 3X stronger under lab testing. When installing EXTREME, deck boards will simply be attached on one side. This enables the natural occurrence of expansion and contraction. Biscuit fasteners such as the EXTREME will fit into the deck board's edge slot. Contractors might want to router the 5/32 in. side groove, use a biscuit joiner on site, or attain pre-grooved decking/patio boards. Deck screws penetrate at a 45 angle through the fastener; to the lower groove edge of the board; and into to the joist beneath. By installing each deck board side-by-side combined with the EXTREME fastener, you will get consistent board gaps due to the EXTREME's gap spacer leg. The leg is integrated into the mold.For edge-mount grooved hardwood deck boards ensuring smooth surfacesLab tested to be up to 3X stronger than other edge-mount systems without steel insertsMolded polyethylene with hardened stainless steel insert for added hold-downPolyethylene provides UV and chemical resistance; black oxide coated steel insert resists corrosionIntegrated gap spacer leg automatically spaces deck boards at 3/32 in. gapHidden inside board gaps creating fastener-free deck surfacesInstalled on 1 side of boards only for natural expansion and contraction of boardsPail includes: 525-fasteners; 565-deck screws; 3-high speed 1/8 in. drill bits; 3-T15 star driver tips, 1-instruction sheet and fastens 300 sq. ft. of decking"
